# IS-733-Week6-Datamining
## Project Overview  

This project focuses on **Binary Classification using Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machines (SVM)**. The dataset used in this analysis is **"student_data.csv"**, which contains features related to student performance.

### Key Steps in the Analysis:
- **Loaded the dataset** and explored its structure (shape, head, tail, and statistical summary).
- **Data Preprocessing**:
  - Checked for missing values.
  - Standardized the dataset using `StandardScaler` to normalize feature values.
- **Model Training & Evaluation**:
  - Implemented **Logistic Regression** for binary classification.
  - Implemented **Support Vector Machines (SVM)** to compare classification performance.
  - Split the dataset into **training and testing sets**.
  - Tuned hyperparameters using **GridSearchCV** for optimal model performance.
  - Measured **accuracy, ROC-AUC score, and plotted ROC curves**.
- **Results Comparison**:
  - Evaluated and compared **Logistic Regression vs. SVM performance**.
  - Identified the **best model for student classification**.

This project demonstrates **machine learning techniques** for **binary classification**, comparing the effectiveness of **Logistic Regression and SVM** in predictive modeling.
